                                13 years old, the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in

                                must do to protect children's privacy and safety online.

                                law in the United States and the concepts they include have played a significant role in
                                the development of data protection laws around the globe. Understanding the Fair
                                Information Practice Principles and how they should be implemented is critical to comply
                                with the various privacy laws that protect personal information.
                                In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices we will take the following
                                responsive action, should a data breach occur:</p>

                                individuals have enforceable rights against data users, but also that individuals have
                                recourse to courts or government agencies to investigate and/or prosecute non-compliance
